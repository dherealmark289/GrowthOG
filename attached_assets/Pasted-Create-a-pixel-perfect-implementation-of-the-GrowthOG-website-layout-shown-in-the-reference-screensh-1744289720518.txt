     * Campaign Builder (with external link icon) - MUST link directly to the dashboard

3. Resources Page Layout:
   - Match the heading "Resources" with subtitle "Expert insights on SEO, link-building, and SaaS growth"

6. Functionality Requirements:
   - DO NOT change any functionality of the website

This implementation should be a 1:1 visual match to the screenshots while preserving ALL functionality of the current application. The goal is to create an identical visual representation without changing any behavior or functionality of the existing site. Pay particular attention to the left sidebar with "Blog" and "Tools" sections, ensuring they appear and function exactly as shown in the screenshots.

Facing stiff competition and tight finances, a beginner in SEO turned their luck around 
with our focused link-building approach.
Client's background
1.	Industry: Collaboration & performance AI for individuals & teams
2.	Location: Sydney, Australia
3.	Company size:  Small business (11–50 employees)
4.	Project budget: Bootstrapped
5.	Targeted Audience: Individuals and teams focused on self-development, goal setting, and enhancing personal and professional performance.
6.	Content assets:
•	Targeted, High-value content: The content focuses on key areas like personal development, performance coaching, and AI integration. This creates opportunities for high-quality backlinks from reputable sources.
•	Optimized structure and Internal linking: The blog features clear headings and organized sections, improving readability and navigation. Internal links to related content guide users to explore more and create valuable link-building opportunities.
•	UX and User engagement: The blog’s intuitive design, with clear CTAs and embedded YouTube videos, enhances user engagement and encourages longer visits. 
Challenges
The client initially managed everything internally, from content creation to link outreach, but their organic traffic stagnated, and there was a lack of high-quality traffic that could convert into valuable sign-ups. Despite some DR leverage, their backlink profile lacked quality, which led to declining traffic as Google updates rolled out. 
Strategies
The Growth OG team began by conducting a comprehensive audit of the site’s backlink profile and content. We identified pages with untapped potential that were already ranking but needed the right push to climb higher in search results. 
With a focus on high-authority, niche-relevant backlinks, we strategically acquired links from domains that could significantly boost organic performance, all while optimizing the use of available resources within a lean budget. 
In parallel, we guided the team on content optimization to align with the link-building strategy, allowing them to focus on creating exceptional content while we managed the acquisition of backlinks.
This collaboration helped drive stronger, more sustainable traffic growth, increase Domain Rating by one point, and achieve a 40% growth in organic keyword rankings within 6 months.

Implementation

2.	Targeted pages:

Results
Please note that the “Post-Campaign” metrics captured in this case study are analyzed from the beginning of our collaboration until three months after the last link-building activity concluded (October 2024). This approach is taken because the effects of link-building efforts often manifest gradually over time.

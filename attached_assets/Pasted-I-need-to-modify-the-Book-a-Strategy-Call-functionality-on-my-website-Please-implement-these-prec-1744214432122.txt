12. FUNCTIONALITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - When "Book a Strategy Call" button is clicked in navigation, the popup sequence starts at Step 1
    - Each step's "Next" button advances to the next step in sequence
    - Each step's "Back" button returns to the previous step
    - The close (×) button closes the popup at any step
    - In Step 3, multiple checkboxes can be selected
    - In Step 4, only one radio option can be selected
    - In Step 5, form validation:
      * Name and Email are required fields
      * Email must be in valid format
      * Show error indicators for invalid fields
    - In final step (Step 6):
      * "Book a Strategy Call" button should link to: https://calendly.com/russell-jba/30min
      * "Build My Strategy" button should trigger appropriate action

13. STATE PERSISTENCE:
    - User selections should be preserved when navigating back and forth between steps
    - If user closes popup and reopens, the sequence should start from beginning

14. RESPONSIVE BEHAVIOR:
    - On mobile devices (width < 640px):
      * Popup width should adjust to 90% of viewport
      * Option grid in Step 3 should stack to single column
      * Option cards in Step 6 should stack to single column
      * Form elements and buttons should adjust for touch-friendly sizes
    - Ensure the popup is scrollable if content exceeds viewport height
    - Maintain readability of all text elements at all screen sizes

15. VISUAL TOUCHES:
    - Smooth transitions between steps (fade or slide effect)
    - Subtle hover effects on clickable elements
    - Focus states for form elements
    - Loading indicator during submission if needed

Please implement these changes with pixel-perfect accuracy to match the provided screenshots. The popup sequence should replace the current /book-a-call/ page functionality and be triggered directly from the "Book a Strategy Call" button in the main navigation.
